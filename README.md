# SimpsonsEpisodes
F# fun to parse wikipedia entries of simpsons episodes.

A way for me to learn some of the fun things that F# can do whilst nerding out on simpsons knowledge.

### What does this do? ###

The idea is to scrape information from the list of simpsons episodes, getting the summary and the wikipedia url to the episode page.
With this download the episode page and get the episode summary and plot.

With all of this text info, find out how often each character is mentioned compared to the total number of words.

Then plot this in a cool way with WebSharper and D3.


### Why? ###

well ..........
